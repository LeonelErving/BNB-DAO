# All for BNB

First, Binance will try to lay out almost all leading players in the ecological niche
Domain, cannot be absent;<br>
The second is that all actions will try to empower BNB. Until now, I still remember the slogan that Binance co-founder He Yi once shouted that BNB is bigger than Binance many years ago.<br>
When launching Greenfield, Binance’s official slogan was, one coin, three chains.<br>
BNB Greenfield does not issue new native assets, but continues to use BNB as the core Token, one token, and three public chains.<br>
Since then, the three public chains of BNB Chain have linked the three public chain worlds respectively to form an ecosystem:

1. BNB Beacon Chain is developed based on Cosmos-SDK
It can be linked with Cosmos ecology through IBC;<br>

2. BNB Smart Chain is compatible with EVM and can be linked with other EVM compatible chains and Layer2;<br>

3. BNB Greenfield based on the rights and interests of the Tendermint consensus
Pro smart contracts are combined with decentralization.<br>

Greenfield Whitepaper
The goal of the BNB Greenfield is to unleash the power of decentralized blockchain and storage technology on data ownership and data economy.

BNB Greenfield is not only a new blockchain in BNB but also an infrastructure and ecosystem targeting to facilitate the decentralized data economy. It tries to achieve it by easing the process to store and manage data access and linking data ownership with the massive DeFi context of BSC.

It focuses on 3 parts that differ from existing centralized and decentralized storage systems:<br>

It enables Ethereum-compatible addresses to create and manage both data and token assets.<br>

It natively links data permissions and management logic onto BSC as exchangeable assets and smart contract programs with all other assets.<br>

It provides developers with similar API primitives and performance as popular existing Web2 cloud storage.<br>

It is expected that Greenfield will set up a playground and test field for new data economy and dApp models, which eventually becomes part of the foundation for Web3.<br>

The white paper in this repository describes the main design and implementation of the platform. Many ideas are based on the great contributions of other leading protocols and teams. Please refer to the acknowledgment sections.<br>

Any constructive opinions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.<br>

Hope everyone enjoys the journey!<br>

## BNB DAO
It is a real DAO, everything is determined by the program rather than controlled by people.

DAO is short for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Simply put, a DAO is an organization controlled by computer code and programs. Therefore, it is able to function autonomously without the intervention of a central authority.

By using smart contracts, DAOs can process external information and execute commands based on them - all without any human intervention. DAOs are typically run by a community of stakeholders incentivized through some sort of token mechanism.
The DAO's rules and transaction records are stored transparently on the blockchain. These rules are usually voted on by stakeholders. Typically, the way decisions are made in a DAO is through proposals. If a proposal is voted on by a majority of stakeholders (or satisfies some other set of rules in the network consensus rules), it will be implemented.
In some ways, a DAO works like a corporation or a nation-state, but in a more decentralized way. Traditional organizations use hierarchical structures and many layers of bureaucracy, but DAOs have no hierarchy. Instead, DAOs use economic mechanisms to align the interests of the organization with those of its members, often through the use of game theory.
Members of DAO are not bound by any formal contract, but are bound together by common goals and network incentives, which are closely related to consensus rules. These rules are fully transparent and codified in the open source software governing the organization. Since DAOs operate without boundaries, they may be subject to different legal jurisdictions.<br>

As the name suggests, DAO has the characteristics of decentralization and autonomy. It is decentralized because there is no single entity that makes and executes decisions. And autonomous because it can function on its own.<br>

Once a DAO is deployed, it cannot be controlled by a single party, but rather governed by a community of participants. If the governance rules defined in the protocol are well designed, they should be able to guide the participants towards the most beneficial outcome for the network.<br>

Simply put, DAOs provide an operating system for open collaboration. This operating system allows individuals and institutions to collaborate without knowing or trusting each other.

### BNB DAO Ecological Model

zcp is developed based on bnb, with a circulation of 200 million
1 bnb = 500 zcp

hy is developed based on bnb, with a circulation of 30,000


static

25% of bnb's new performance every day is weighted according to the investment amount of the whole network

Invest in multiples of 0.1 bnb to participate, and distribute one-tenth of the participating number of zcp to the wallet for the first time, and 1.8 times the number of bnb will be out

All dynamic bonuses are accelerated statically by 1.8 times. After being out, you need to re-roll. If you don’t vote again, you can’t take away the dynamic bonus.

dynamic

Dao1-Dao7 assessment criteria
Sun line, counting from the first generation
Dao1 The sum of small sectors is 1 BNB<br>

The sum of Dao2 small sectors is 10 BNB<br>

The sum of Dao3 small sectors is 50 BNB<br>

The sum of Dao4 small sectors is 200BNB<br>

The sum of Dao5 small sectors is 1000BNB<br>

The sum of Dao6 small sectors is 2000BNB<br>

The sum of Dao7 small departments is 5000BNB<br>


There are seven levels of team awards, with a 3%-21% difference in new performance under the Dao1-Dao7 umbrella, calculated from the first generation

Seven Levels of Community Awards
Each level of Dao1-Dao7 is divided into an average of 3% of the new performance of the entire network every day according to the number of daos, and each level is superimposed and calculated

Incentive pool: 6%<br>

Circular incentive 50% (settlement 24 hours a day)<br>

(1.5% of which will be given to the top 5 direct promotion orders of the day, 40%, 30%, 20, 5%, 5%<br>

The other 1.5% will be given to the top 5 direct push orders on the day, 40%, 30%, 20%, 5%, 5%<br>

Compensation Pool 2%<br>

If there is no contribution within 24 hours, the last 100 will be rewarded,<br>
Last place 40% <br>
Bottom 2-100 60% share <br>
If the compensation pool accumulates to 10,000 BNB, the contract will be triggered, and the currency value management team will be promoted to launch zcp on the exchange

Community ranking 6% (weekly ranking according to the sum of small departments and new performance)<br>

2% for the first place, 1% for the second place, 0.5% for the third place, 2.5% for the fourth-twentieth place

4% of the Dao committee rewards the contributing dao committee members (dao committee members are recommended by the community and need a place and evangelists)<br>

Technology Fund 5%<br>

Ecological Fund 5%<br>

ZCP currency value management 5%<br>
