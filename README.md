# All for BNB

First, Binance will try to lay out almost all leading players in the ecological niche<br>
Domain, cannot be absent;<br>
The second is that all actions will try to empower BNB. Until now, I still remember the slogan that Binance co-founder He Yi once shouted that BNB is bigger than Binance many years ago.<br>
When launching Greenfield, Binance’s official slogan was, one coin, three chains.<br>
BNB Greenfield does not issue new native assets, but continues to use BNB as the core Token, one token, and three public chains.<br>
Since then, the three public chains of BNB Chain have linked the three public chain worlds respectively to form an ecosystem:<br>

1. BNB Beacon Chain is developed based on Cosmos-SDK<br>
It can be linked with Cosmos ecology through IBC;<br>
2. BNB Smart Chain is compatible with EVM and can be linked with other EVM compatible chains and Layer2;<br>
3. BNB Greenfield based on the rights and interests of the Tendermint consensus<br>
Pro smart contracts are combined with decentralization.<br>

## BNB DAO Ecological Model<br>

zcp is developed based on bnb, with a circulation of 200 million, and it is the first time to participate in the address airdrop 1 bnb = 500 zcp<br>


hy is developed based on bnb, with a circulation of 30,000<br>


static<br>

25% of bnb's new performance every day is weighted according to the investment amount of the whole network<br>

Invest in multiples of 0.1 bnb to participate, and distribute one-tenth of the participating number of zcp to the wallet for the first time, and 1.8 times the number of bnb will be out

All dynamic bonuses are accelerated statically by 1.8 times. After being out, you need to re-roll. If you don’t vote again, you can’t take away the dynamic bonus.<br>
